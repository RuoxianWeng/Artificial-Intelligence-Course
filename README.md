# Artificial-Intelligence-Course
The open-source Berkeley AI Pacman Project

## Key Features:
- The project revolves around implementing AI agents that play a variant of the Pacman game.
- Written in Python and provides a modular framework that supports various AI techniques.
- The project is broken into several parts, each focused on a different AI concepts.

## AI Concepts: 
- Search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, etc.)
- Multi-agent systems (e.g., Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning)
- Reinforcement learning (Q-learning, Value Iteration)
- Probabilistic models (Bayes nets, Hidden Markov Models)
